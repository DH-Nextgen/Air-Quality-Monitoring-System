Urban air pollution is a significant environmental issue characterized by high levels of pollutants in densly populated areas with heavy traffic and industrial activities. The problem affects various groups including city residents and commuters, health-conscious individuals, parents and caregivers.Currently Sri Lanka lacks real-time air quality monitoring systems leaving people unaware of daily pollution levels.So my project aims to address new portable air quality monitoring system to track pollutants levels and display on oled screen and intrgrate mobile app using blynk. Finally calculate air quality index and send users to notification using telegram bot.In this poject, I measure CO2, PM2.5, VOC, Temperature and Humidity
